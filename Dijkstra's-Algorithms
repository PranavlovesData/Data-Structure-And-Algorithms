In this program we will Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s.
This is also known as "Dutch National Flag problem". as it can be used to sort color red, white and blue to make flag.
The problem is similar to "Segregate 0s and 1s in an array".
The problem was posed with three colors, here `0', `1' and `2'. The array is divided into four sections: 
arr[1] to arr[low - 1]
arr[low] to arr[mid - 1]
arr[mid] to arr[high - 1]
arr[high] to arr[n]
If the ith element is 0 then swap the element to the low range.
Similarly, if the element is 1 then keep it as it is.
If the element is 2 then swap it with an element in high range.


class Solution:
    def sort012(self,arr,n):
        # code here
        low=0
        mid=0
        high=n-1
        while mid <= high:
          if arr[mid] ==0:
              arr[mid],arr[low]=arr[low],arr[mid]
              mid+=1
              low+=1
          elif arr[mid]==1:
            mid+=1
          else:
            arr[mid],arr[high]=arr[high],arr[mid]
            high-=1
