Kidane's Alogrithm
Its an anlgorithm used to find contiguous sum of sub array but in simpler way than "Brute force method" which involves iteration through all subarrays and finding 
which one has largest sum of sub array 

Brute Force Method:
#######################################################

def  BruteForceEx(self,arr,N):
    max=arr[0]
    
    for i in range(N):
       sum=0
      for j in range(N):
          sum+=arr[j]
          if sum > max:
            max=sum
     return max
     
   

Kidane's Algorithm:
#########################################################
 
def KidaneAlgoEx(self,arr,N):
  max=arr[0]  or -10000000
  curr=0
  for i in range(N):
    curr +=arr[i]
    if curr>max:
      max=curr
    if curr<0:
      curr=0
   return max
   
   Now what we are doing here is simply adding elements of subarray in curr untill curr becomes larger than max 
   Then we update value of max to curr value
   Whats diff here is that we are not running summation for all subarray rather when value of curr reaches less than zero we set it to zero 
   Hence every time curr value is negative it doesnt affect max and we remove it and when value of curr in less than max we dont add it to max
