Longest Common Prefix in an Array : Given a array of N strings, find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array.
---------------------------------

Examples: Input: 
N = 4
arr[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek,
         geezer}

Output: gee
Explanation: "gee" is the longest common
prefix in all the given strings.

Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {hello, world}

Output: -1
Explanation: There's no common prefix
in the given strings.


# Approach 1:

First of all we need to find the smallest string in the array. we can store it in a variable and compare it with other element in the array.
Then each time a substring element is found in the array we count it. and at the end compare to check if count==len(arr)
At the end we return the variable with longest prefix.

       if n<2:      # ie only 1 element
          return -1
       arr.sort()
       str=arr[0]   # variable containing smallest string
       arr.remove(arr[0])   # now that we have taken the smallest string it can be removed
       val=""
       for i in range(len(str)):                     # this loop runs for each letter of string: 0:g,1:e,2:e,3:k
            count=0  
            for j in arr:                            # Now we compare if each letter of string is present in all element of array
                if str[i]==j[i]:
                    count+=1
                else:
                    break
            if count==len(arr):                # checking if letter is in all element by comparing the size of count with array.
                 val+=str[i]                   # store the letter thats present
            else:
                break
       if len(val)==0:                         # if the val is 0 means there is no common prefix hence return -1
            return -1
       return val
